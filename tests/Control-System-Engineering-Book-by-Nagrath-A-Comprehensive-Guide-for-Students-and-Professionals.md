In this article, we will review some of the hot topics in control system engineering that are relevant for students and professionals who want to keep up with the latest developments and trends in the field. Some of these topics are:
  
- Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for automation: IIoT refers to the network of smart devices, sensors, actuators and controllers that can communicate and exchange data over the internet or other networks. IIoT enables new levels of connectivity, interoperability, intelligence and efficiency for industrial applications. IIoT can also facilitate remote monitoring, control, diagnostics and maintenance of control systems.
- Calibration of control systems: Calibration is the process of ensuring that the measurements and outputs of a control system are accurate and consistent with the standards or specifications. Calibration is essential for maintaining the performance, reliability and safety of control systems. Calibration can be done manually or automatically, using various methods and instruments.
- Applying automation to various domains: Automation is the use of control systems to operate processes or machines with minimal or no human intervention. Automation can improve productivity, quality, safety and sustainability in various domains, such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, healthcare and more. Automation can also involve different levels of complexity and autonomy, from simple feedback loops to advanced artificial intelligence.

These are just some of the hot topics in control system engineering that you can learn more about from *Control Systems Engineering* by Nagrath and Gopal. The book covers these topics and many more in depth, with clear explanations, examples and exercises. The book also provides guidance on how to use MATLAB for control system analysis and design.
